## About

Thanks for taking a look into my site, this is a piece of portfolio works emulating a news website.

_This site uses an API for it's backend that I also created as a portfolio piece, if you would like to learn more please follow this link https://github.com/JDean8/be-nc-news_

## Using the App

To access the site you must be signed in (there is a button on the home page that will let you automatically sign in using a demo account).

Once you are signed in you should be presented with a few articles that are suggested due to their metrics.

At the top of this page and in the Navbar at the top of the screen there should be a link to take you to all articles as well as links for some specific topics that you may find interesting.

Once you are on an article page you can select what the list is sorted by as well as how it is ordered.

Once you click into an article you should be able to vote on the article and other users comments, along with being able to create a comment and delete any previous comments made by the account that you are signed in with.

## Setting up locally
